# Interpretable Embedding Procedure Knowledge Transfer
- Implementation of "Interpretable embedding procedure knowledge transfer" on AAAI2021.

# Paper abstract
This paper proposes a method of generating interpretable embedding procedure knowledge based on principal component analysis, and distilling it based on a message passing neural network. Experimental results show that the student network trained by the proposed KD method improves 2.28% in the CIFAR100 dataset, which is higher performance than the state-of-the-art method. We also demonstrate that the embedding procedure knowledge is interpretable via visualization of the proposed KD process.
